Things I want to add:

* Parse out structs and such from a C file
* x86 / x64 / other assembly languages
* Make sure I'm not converting u64 to usize
* Do I need H2Pointer at all?
* If an array is static, simplify the size
* Bitmaps / flags
* Maybe split out characters again?
* Type/length/value
* Consider separating to_string() from display()
